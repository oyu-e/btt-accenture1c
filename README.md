# Breakthrough Tech - Team Accenture 1C

## Project Overview
This project, **Technology News Insights Engine**, was developed as part of the AI Studio Challenge with Accenture and Breakthrough Tech. The goal was to explore and analyze technology news articles, providing insights through detailed visualizations and analysis.

## Objectives and Goals
Objective 1: Analyze tech articles using knowledge graphs

Objective 2: Create queries to gain more insight on the data

Objective 3: Learn more about how we can apply ML techniques to industry practices

## Methodology
The project utilized:

Google Colab for running Python-based notebooks, enabling accessible and efficient computation.
- Libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and networkx for data manipulation and visualization.
- Data Exploration: Focused on understanding the dataset and identifying patterns.
- Graph Creation: Visualized trends, correlations, and key insights using tools like bar graphs, line graphs, and network diagrams.
- Results and Key Findings: Sentiment varies across industry. We closely analyzed Banking, Capital Markets, and Communication + Media. [Click](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tmuB9GFQeSP4wxbp4Kkx7Lf5em79JSLP5oRZpvosN30/edit?usp=sharing) to view our presentation!
- Potential Next Steps: Incorporate additional datasets to expand the scope of analysis. Enhance visualizations with interactive dashboards.
